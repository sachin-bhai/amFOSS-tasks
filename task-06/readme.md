This was my first time creating a discord bot so I watched a YouTube video on it. I've done web scraping in the past so I was no stranger to the bs4 module. I found the specific tags for the teams and scores and used the discord python module to send messages on command.

It has three commands as per the requirements.

**/livescore to recieve live match updates**<br>
**/generate to recieve a csv of all currently ongoing matches!!**<br>
**/help to receive command list**
