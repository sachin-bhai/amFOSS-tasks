## Terminal Hunt

1. I cloned the repo provided by using the command ```git clone https://github.com/KshitijThareja/TerminalWizard.git```

2. After cd-ing into the Terminal Wizard folder I created the codes folder using ```mkdir codes```.

3. Solving the first stage gets us to the folder 06, and to read the Spell_05 we use the command ```cat Spell_05.txt```. We move to the spellbook and execute the file with the spell from Spell_05 ```python {SpellName}```.

4. We can add the code obtained to the folder using the ```cat > 01.txt``` command.

11. Use ```git log``` to get the logs and use ```git checkout theGraveyard``` to switch to graveyard.

12. We can add the code obtained to the folder using the ```cat > 04.txt``` command.

For the final part 

13. ``` cat 01.txt 02.txt 03.txt > finalcode.txt ```

14. use ```rm {fileName}``` to remove the files.

15. After decoding the message we find a link to a repo, that we clone using ```git clone {repoLink}.git```.

16. cd into TheFinalSpell Repo and ```cat TheOneThatEndsItAll```.
