# amFOSS-tasks

## An Introduction

Hey amFOSS, I'm Sachin Shreekumar currently a second year student from the Electronics and Communication branch. I've been developing for a little over a year now and amFOSS has been a huge factor in helping me do so. My hobbies are cricket and music.

### Why should we choose you?

I like solving real world problems and making bots to make life easier for the average person. I love working with data and have been looking into ML models with huge data bases. I just like the idea of 'predicting' outputs with mathematical models and I feel that has a huge real world applications from health to sports.

### What are your goals for the next six months? How will you accomplish them?

I want to make open source contributions to either Flutter or ML projects. For one I need to get better at training models and I've been watching a YouTube playlist with the required topics. I would like to become more consistent with my contributions and put aside at least one hour a day for open source contributions. I want to able to apply to GSoc by next year.

### How will you contribute back to the club?

I'd put the club assigned tasks on top priority and take part in any events hosted by the club.

### Thoughts on the praveshan
Great tasks and learned a lot during the process of completing the tasks.
